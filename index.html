            <p class=" right justify">Back in highschool a couple of activities caught my attention:
                <br> ~ Building a website with HTML only.
                <br> ~ Programming a basic online game.
                <br> Unfortunately, at the time, my mind was set on pursuing a Chemical Engineering degree so it never crossed
                my mind to look more into web development.
                <br> After joining a bootcamp and getting through the first lessons, I can say this is something I want to learn,
                practice and struggle with.
            </p>
            <p class="justify">Born September, 1991 and raised in Mexico City. It wasn't untill April, 2012; after my second semester of college,
                that I moved to California.
                <br> Once here, the plan was to finish college but everything has been about working.
                <br>This bootcamp changed everything; the Portfolio tab shows the improvement and new skills learned over the
                weeks.
